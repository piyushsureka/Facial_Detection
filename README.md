# Facial_Detection
In the past few years, face recognition owned significant consideration and appreciated as one of the most promising applications in the field of image analysis. Face detection can consider a substantial part of face recognition operations. According to its strength to focus computational resources on the section of an image holding a face. The method of face detection in pictures is complicated because of variability present across human faces such as pose, expression, position and orientation, skin colour, the presence of glasses or facial hair, differences in camera gain, lighting conditions, and image resolution.

Object detection is one of the computer technologies, which connected to the image processing and computer vision and it interacts with detecting instances of an object such as human faces, building, tree, car, etc. The primary aim of face detection algorithms is to determine whether there is any face in an image or not.

In recent times, a lot of study work proposed in the field of Face Recognition and Face Detection to make it more advanced and accurate, but it makes a revolution in this field when Viola-Jones comes with its Real-Time Face Detector, which is capable of detecting the faces in real-time with high accuracy.

Face Detection is the first and essential step for face recognition, and it is used to detect faces in the images. It is a part of object detection and can use in many areas such as security, bio-metrics, law enforcement, entertainment, personal safety, etc.

It is used to detect faces in real time for surveillance and tracking of person or objects. It is widely used in cameras to identify multiple appearances in the frame Ex- Mobile cameras and DSLRâ€™s. Facebook is also using face detection algorithm to detect faces in the images and recognise them.
